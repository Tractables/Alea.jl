# Alea.jl

This module provides a Julia prototype implementation of Dice probabilistic programming language (see [https://github.com/SHoltzen/dice](https://github.com/SHoltzen/dice)), and implementation of further features such as distributions over integers, continuous distributions and parameter learning on top of it.

It provides features from the following papers as extensions of Dice.

1. [Scaling Integer Arithmetic in Probabilistic Programs](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/cao23b/cao23b.pdf)
2. HyBit: [Bit Blasting Probabilistic Programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3656412)
